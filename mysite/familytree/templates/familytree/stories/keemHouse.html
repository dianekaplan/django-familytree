<h2>The Keem girls' house</h2>

<p>
I drove Vi/Mom, Helen, and Catherine there when Catherine came for a visit to Buffalo some 15-20 years ago.

No one was home but they wandered about a bit while reminiscing about riding ponies/horses, sledding down the hill in
front of their home (in the street) during the winters, and having one of the first "motor cars" anywhere. It was a
wonderful day, and we didn't get arrested for trespassing!
